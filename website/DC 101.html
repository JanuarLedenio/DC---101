<h3>Next in Line Lyrics:</h3>
<i><p>What has life to offer me when i grow old?<br>
    What's there to look forward to beyond the biting cold<br>
    They say it's difficult, yes, stereotypical<br>
    What's there beyond sleep, eat, work in this cruel life<br>
    Ain't there nothin' else 'round here but human strife<br>
    'Cause they say it's difficult, yes, stereotypical<br>
    Gotta be conventional, you can't be so radical<br>
    So I sing this song to all of my age<br>
    For these are the questions we've got to face<br>
    For in this cycle that we call life<br>
    We are the ones who are next in line<br>
    We are next in line</p>
<p>What has life to offer me when i grow old?<br>
    What's there to look forward to beyond the biting cold<br>
    'Cause they say it's difficult, yes, stereotypical<br>
    Gotta be conventional, you can't be so radical<br>
    So I sing this song to all of my age<br>
    For these are the questions we've got to face<br>
    For in this cycle that we call life<br>
    We are the ones who are next in line<br>
    We are next in line<br>
    (Oh-hoh) We are next in line</p>
    <p>And we gotta work, we gotta feel (we gotta feel)<br>
    Let's open our eyes and do whatever it takes<br>
    We gotta work, we gotta feel (we gotta feel)<br>
    Let's open our eyes (oh-woh)<br>
    And sing this song to all of our age<br>
    For these are the questions we've got to face<br>
    For in this cycle that we call life<br>
    We are the ones who are next in line<br>
    Sing this song for me<br>
    Sing this song for me</i></p>
